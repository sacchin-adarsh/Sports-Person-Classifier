# Sports-Person-Classifier
Description: Developed an intuitive sports person recognition system that allows users to gain information about a sports person by simply dragging and dropping their image. Leveraged the OpenCV library for face and eyes detection, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the system.

Key Features:

Drag and Drop Image: Implemented a user-friendly drag and drop feature that allows users to easily upload an image of a sports person and retrieve relevant information.
OpenCV Face and Eyes Detection: Utilized the powerful OpenCV library to accurately detect faces and eyes in the uploaded images, ensuring precise identification of the sports person.
Data Cleaning using OpenCV: Employed OpenCV's face detection capabilities to perform data cleaning, removing any irrelevant or noisy information and improving the quality of the extracted features.
Feature Engineering using Wavelet Transforms: Utilized wavelet transforms to extract meaningful features from the sports person's image, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of the recognition system.
Model Building with SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest: Developed machine learning models using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms to classify and recognize the sports person based on the extracted features.
Model Fine-Tuning using GridSearchCV: Employed GridSearchCV to fine-tune the model hyperparameters, optimizing the performance of the recognition system and achieving higher accuracy.
UI Design with HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery: Designed an intuitive user interface using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience for users.
By leveraging the power of OpenCV, implementing feature engineering techniques, and building machine learning models, successfully created a sports person recognition system that enables users to effortlessly obtain information about sports personalities by simply uploading their images. The intuitive user interface enhances the overall user experience, making it a valuable tool for sports enthusiasts.
